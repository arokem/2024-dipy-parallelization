This repository contains the materials to generate a report following the April
8th-9th 2024 workshop with the same title (see

## Contributing to this report

This repository uses [quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
to render both a [website](https://uwescience.github.io/2024-open-source-standards-report/) and
a [pdf](https://uwescience.github.io/2024-open-source-standards-report/index.pdf)
of the report.

To contribute to the contents of the report, please edit the `.qmd` files that
are stored under the `sections` directory. You can also add bibliographic items
in the bibtex format to the `references.bib` file.

### Citations in markdown

bibtex key for the entry that you would like to cite. You can also cite two
items in the same position, by using the following: `[@key1, @key2]`.
